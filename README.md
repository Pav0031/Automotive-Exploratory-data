# Auto Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing the Auto dataset using pandas and scikit-learn libraries. The dataset includes information about automobiles, such as their weight, horsepower, origin, and miles per gallon (mpg).

## Overview

The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and predictive modeling using linear regression.

## Files

- `auto_analysis.py`: Python script for data analysis.
- `Auto.csv`: Dataset file in CSV format.
  
# Results
The analysis provides insights into the relationships between automobile features (weight, horsepower, origin) and fuel efficiency (mpg). Key findings include correlations between features and mpg, detection of outliers, and building predictive models to estimate mpg based on different sets of features.

# Conclusions
The analysis demonstrates that the combination of automobile weight, origin (European and Japanese), and horsepower can be effective predictors for estimating fuel efficiency (mpg).  Overall, the findings provide valuable insights for automobile manufacturers and policymakers to optimize fuel efficiency and environmental sustainability in the automotive industry.
